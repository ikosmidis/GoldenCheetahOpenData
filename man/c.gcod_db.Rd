\description{
Concatanate gcod_db objects
}
\details{
If \code{perspective = "remote"}, then \code{...$remote} are concatanated and
\code{...$local_db} from the first object is used. If \code{perspective = "local"},
then \code{...$local} are concatanated and \code{...$remote_db} from the
first object is used. If \code{perspective = "both"} then both  from \code{...$remote} and
\code{...$local_db} are concatanated.

Records with duplicated athlete IDs in the objects being
concatenated are replaced, in the concatanated object, by a single
record with the most recently modified entry.

The mirror is inheritted from the first object supplied for
concatenation.
